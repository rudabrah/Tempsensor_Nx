# Tempsensor_Nx
Kodetest for NxTech - i python
This is a code test for a job interview. I am free to choose my own programing language, and so i fell on python as it is my go to for quick sollutions. 
Depending on the time i will try to solve it in C++ as well.

Python - Use requests to handle the HTTP transfers. The library is quite easy to use and implement.
On first commit i take the provided input and convert it manually and place it in a list. The list needs to holde a buffer of up to 2 mins of data.
The pop-funtion is used to keep the list as short as possible, to avoid to much memory being used.
Ideally i would like to remove the value at once, but i need 2 mins of date to calculate the average as well as give min and max values for the last 2 mins.
